# Count number of results for a given search

Count the number of results for a given search. Useful to check before
attempting to pull down a very large number of records.

## Usage

``` r
arxiv_count(query = NULL, id_list = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- query:

  Search pattern as a string; a vector of such strings is also allowed,
  in which case the elements are combined with `AND`.

- id_list:

  arXiv doc IDs, as comma-delimited string or a vector of such strings

## Value

Number of results (integer). An attribute `"search_info"` contains
information about the search parameters and the time at which it was
performed.

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
if(interactive()) {
    # count papers in category stat.AP (applied statistics)
    arxiv_count(query = "cat:stat.AP")

    # count papers by Peter Hall in any stat category
    arxiv_count(query = 'au:"Peter Hall" AND cat:stat*')

    # count papers for a range of dates
    #    here, everything in 2013
    arxiv_count("submittedDate:[2013 TO 2013]")
} # }
```
